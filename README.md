**ChromaFusion: Unlocking Perceptually Uniform Gradient Color Spaces**
===============================================================

**Tagline:** "Revolutionizing color gradient design with CIELAB-based interpolation and Gamut-Aware Color Mapping"

**Detailed Description:**

ChromaFusion is a Python-based repository that delves into the realm of perceptually uniform gradient color spaces, leveraging the power of CIELAB-based interpolation and Gamut-Aware Color Mapping algorithms. The primary objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive toolkit for designers, developers, and researchers to create and manipulate color gradients that accurately convey visual information, while ensuring optimal color consistency and visual appeal.

By harnessing the CIELAB color space, ChromaFusion enables the creation of gradient color spaces that are perceptually uniform, meaning that the human visual system perceives the color transitions as smooth and consistent. This is achieved through advanced interpolation techniques that take into account the complexities of human color perception. Furthermore, the integration of Gamut-Aware Color Mapping algorithms ensures that the generated gradients are tailored to specific display devices, guaranteeing accurate color reproduction and minimizing color inaccuracies.

The benefits of ChromaFusion are multifaceted. For designers, it provides a robust platform for crafting visually stunning and communicative color gradients. For developers, it offers a versatile toolset for integrating color gradients into various applications, from data visualization to user interface design. For researchers, it presents a unique opportunity to explore the intricacies of human color perception and develop innovative color modeling techniques.

**Installation:**

To install ChromaFusion, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/ewhu/ChromaFusion.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd ChromaFusion`.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Verify the installation by running `python -c "import chromafusion; print(chromafusion.__version__)"`.

**Configuration:**

ChromaFusion relies on the following environment variables:

* `CHROMAFUSION_COLOR_SPACE`: Specifies the color space used for interpolation (default: CIELAB).
* `CHROMAFUSION_GAMUT_MAPPER`: Selects the Gamut-Aware Color Mapping algorithm (default: Adobe RGB).

**Usage:**

To generate a perceptually uniform color gradient using ChromaFusion, follow this example:

This code snippet creates a GradientGenerator instance, specifying the CIELAB color space and Adobe RGB gamut mapper. The `generate_gradient` method is then used to create a 256-step color gradient between black and white.
